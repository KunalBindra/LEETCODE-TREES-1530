# LEETCODE-TREES-1530
Let's walk through a dry run of the given solution to understand how it works. The function `countPairs` counts the number of good leaf node pairs within a given distance in a binary tree.

### Solution Overview:
1. **CountPairs Method**:
   - Calls the `dfs` helper method to traverse the tree.
   - Returns the answer stored in `ans`.

2. **DFS Method**:
   - Recursively traverses the tree and calculates the number of good leaf node pairs.
   - Uses an array `d` to keep track of leaf node distances.

### Detailed Dry Run:

Consider a simple binary tree:

```
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   / \   / \
  4   5 6   7
```

Assume `distance = 3`.

1. **Initial Call**: `countPairs(root, 3)`
   - `dfs(root, 3)` where `root` is node 1.
   
2. **First Call to DFS (Node 1)**:
   - `dfs(root.left, 3)` where `root.left` is node 2.
   
3. **Second Call to DFS (Node 2)**:
   - `dfs(root.left, 3)` where `root.left` is node 4.

4. **Third Call to DFS (Node 4)**:
   - Node 4 is a leaf, so `d = [1, 0, 0, 0]` and returns to Node 2.
   
5. **Back to Node 2**:
   - `dfs(root.right, 3)` where `root.right` is node 5.

6. **Fourth Call to DFS (Node 5)**:
   - Node 5 is a leaf, so `d = [1, 0, 0, 0]` and returns to Node 2.
   
7. **Back to Node 2**:
   - Combine results of Node 4 and Node 5.
   - `dl = [1, 0, 0, 0]` and `dr = [1, 0, 0, 0]`.
   - Calculate pairs:
     - `i = 0, j = 0`: `i + j + 2 = 2 <= 3`, so `ans += 1 * 1 = 1`.
   - Update distances: `d = [0, 2, 0, 0]` (no nodes at distance 0, 2 nodes at distance 1, no nodes at distances 2 and 3).
   
8. **Return to Node 1**:
   - `dfs(root.right, 3)` where `root.right` is node 3.
   
9. **Fifth Call to DFS (Node 3)**:
   - `dfs(root.left, 3)` where `root.left` is node 6.

10. **Sixth Call to DFS (Node 6)**:
    - Node 6 is a leaf, so `d = [1, 0, 0, 0]` and returns to Node 3.
    
11. **Back to Node 3**:
    - `dfs(root.right, 3)` where `root.right` is node 7.

12. **Seventh Call to DFS (Node 7)**:
    - Node 7 is a leaf, so `d = [1, 0, 0, 0]` and returns to Node 3.
    
13. **Back to Node 3**:
    - Combine results of Node 6 and Node 7.
    - `dl = [1, 0, 0, 0]` and `dr = [1, 0, 0, 0]`.
    - Calculate pairs:
      - `i = 0, j = 0`: `i + j + 2 = 2 <= 3`, so `ans += 1 * 1 = 1`.
    - Update distances: `d = [0, 2, 0, 0]` (no nodes at distance 0, 2 nodes at distance 1, no nodes at distances 2 and 3).
    
14. **Return to Node 1**:
    - Combine results of Node 2 and Node 3.
    - `dl = [0, 2, 0, 0]` and `dr = [0, 2, 0, 0]`.
    - Calculate pairs:
      - `i = 0, j = 1`: `i + j + 2 = 3 <= 3`, so `ans += 0 * 2 = 0`.
      - `i = 1, j = 0`: `i + j + 2 = 3 <= 3`, so `ans += 2 * 0 = 0`.
      - Total pairs = 0.
    - Update distances: `d = [0, 0, 4, 0]` (no nodes at distance 0 or 1, 4 nodes at distance 2, no nodes at distance 3).

### Final Result:
- `ans = 2` (pairs (4, 5) and (6, 7) within distance 3).

Thus, the function correctly counts the number of good leaf node pairs within the given distance.
